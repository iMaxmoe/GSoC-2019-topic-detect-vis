### Why create this page?

With my delving into the project, although it is officially a visualization project, to increase its novelty and practicality, I find the data processing part, i.e. the NLP part is equally important to the visualization part. Without insightful information extracted from raw data, it is hard to create excellent visualization work. 

Therefore, I maintain this page to retrieve some appealing work done by other people for reference.
