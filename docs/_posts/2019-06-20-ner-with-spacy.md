# Named Entity Recognition with `spaCy`

### 1. `NLTK` or `spaCy` ?

|       |                             PROS                             |                CONS                |
| ----- | :----------------------------------------------------------: | :--------------------------------: |
| NLTK  | Academia & Many third party extensions & plenty of approaches to each NLP task | quite slow & hard to learn and use |
| spaCy |         fast & easy to use & neural network provided         | less flexibility & fewer language  |

Considering the requirement of our project, at current stage, we choose `spaCy` for the ease of development.

### 2. Use `spaCy` to conduct NER

### 3. Generate Word Cloud from NEs

### 4. Generate Directional Graph NEs
